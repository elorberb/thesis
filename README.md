## 🎯 Project Objective
The main goal is to construct a pipeline capable of assessing the maturity index of a cannabis flower given an image. This is achieved through the segmentation and classification of trichomes which are indicative of the flower's maturity stage.


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was meticulously built in collaboration with Rohama Greenhouse over a span of 9 weeks. The images encapsulate the progressive growth of the cannabis flowers throughout this period. All photographs were captured using an iPhone 14 Pro coupled with a 10X magnifying lens to ensure precision and clarity.


## 🏷️ Labeling Guidelines
The labeling process is conducted using the [segments.ai](https://segments.ai/) interface, which facilitates convenient labeling of the trichomes on the cannabis flowers. Through this interface, labels can be applied to identify and classify the trichomes, which in turn aids in assessing the maturity index of the cannabis flowers. Further instructions on how to use the segments.ai interface for labeling, as well as standards and guidelines for labeling, will be provided to ensure consistency and accuracy in the data.
