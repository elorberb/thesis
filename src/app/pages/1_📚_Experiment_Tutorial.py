# Experiment GUI Tutorial

Welcome to the tutorial for our Trichome Classification Experiment. This guide will help you understand how to interact with the experiment's GUI and efficiently review images.

## Understanding the Experiment Interface

The experiment interface is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Main Area

- This is where the images of cannabis trichomes will be displayed.
- Each image needs to be reviewed and classified.

<div>
    <img src="{image_display_area}" alt="Image Display Area" style="width: {width}%; height: auto;">
</div>

### 2. Sidebar - Feedback and Controls

- Here, you will find sliders to adjust the percentage of different trichome types.
- The sliders include:
    - **Clear Trichomes (%)**: Adjust the percentage of clear trichomes.
    - **Cloudy Trichomes (%)**: Adjust the percentage of cloudy trichomes.
    - **Amber Trichomes (%)**: Adjust the percentage of amber trichomes.
    - **Maturity Level (0-10)**: Indicate the maturity level of the trichomes.

<div>
    <img src="{sidebar_feedback}" alt="Sidebar Feedback" style="width: {width}%; height: auto;">
</div>


## Flow of Reviewing Images

### Step 1: Image Review

- When you enter the experiment page, an image will automatically be loaded for review.
- Observe the trichomes in the image carefully.

### Step 2: Adjusting Sliders

- Based on your observation, use the sliders in the sidebar to estimate the percentages of clear, cloudy, and amber trichomes.
- Make sure the total percentage sums up to 100%.

### Step 3: Submitting Your Feedback

- After adjusting the sliders, click on the **Next Image** button to submit your feedback.
- This action will save your inputs and load the next image for review.

<div>
    <img src="{adjusting_sliders}" alt="Adjusting Sliders" style="width: {width}%; height: auto;">
</div>


### Step 4: Completing the Experiment

- Continue the process of reviewing images and submitting feedback.
- Once all images have been reviewed, a message will thank you for your participation.

<div>
    <img src="{submit_feedback}" alt="Submit Feedback" style="width: {width}%; height: auto;">
</div>
