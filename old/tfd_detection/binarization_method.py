    Detects circles in an image of trichomes, draws a red circle around each detected trichome, and displays the
    resulting image. Prints the total number of detected trichomes in the console.

    Args:
        path (str): The file path of the image to be processed.
        total (int, optional): The total number of trichomes in the image. If provided, this value will be
